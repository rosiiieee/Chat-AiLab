**Foreword and Purpose**
The PLM Revised Student Manual is a source of important information, including student responsibilities, obligations, and privileges. This revised version incorporates an updated list of academic policies and significant enhancement of other provisions relating to student discipline and student activities. These rules and regulations are presented for ready reference and are designed to provide positive and constructive guidelines for student behavior and discipline.

The revision of the 2012 Student Manual was initiated by the University through the Student Manual Revision Committee. Existing policies and procedures were reviewed, leading to amendments/revisions to address new issues and questions of the present time. Revised regulations, particularly on academic policies, are incorporated, and stringent implementation of these policies is expected to create a level of consistency across the University.

The basic purpose of these policies and regulations is to further the mission of the University and protect the well-being of the entire PLM community, especially the students. These rules enable all University members to function as a community and respond to situations accordingly. They are referenced on the vision and mission of PLM and are intended to ultimately help fulfill the goals of academic excellence and social responsibility, while furthering the core value of integrity, which is purposely embedded in PLM's disciplinary policies.

Students are the primary stakeholders of PLM and the foremost consideration of the rules and regulations being implemented. The University expands its services essentially for the poor but deserving students of the City of Manila, upholding the best welfare of the students.

**Title 1: The PLM Education**

**History of the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila (PLM)**
*   **Conception:** PLM's conception began during the administration of Mayor Arsenio H. Lacson, the first elective mayor of the City of Manila in 1951, when Ordinance No. 4202 was approved on January 13, 1960, allocating P1-Million to establish the University.
*   **Realization:** After Mayor Lacson passed away, his successor, Vice-Mayor Antonio Villegas, worked for the realization of the university. Mayor Villegas issued Executive Order No. 7, s-1963, on February 13, 1963, creating a Planning and Working Committee chaired by Dr. Benito F. Reyes.
*   **National Legislation:** In 1964, Mayor Villegas gained the support of Congressman Justo R. Albert, who sponsored House Bill No. 8349. Senators Gil Puyat and Camilo Osias spearheaded the Senate version. Congressman Albert stressed that the university would relieve education from the "grip of profit-motivated corporations".
*   **University Charter:** The consolidated bill was passed by the joint Congress in May and June 1965. On **June 19, 1965**, President Diosdado P. Macapacal signed the bill into law, titled "An Act Authorizing the City of Manila to Establish and Operate the University of the City of Manila and for Other Purposes," captioned as **Republic Act No. 4196**, which serves as the University Charter.
*   **Significance:** The birth of Pamantasan on June 19th coincides with the birthday of Dr. Jose P. Rizal, whose philosophy of education centered on cultivating intelligence and elevating the country to glory.
*   **Naming and Governance:** Mayor Villegas named the University "Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila" in 1967. The Board of Regents, the governing body, was formally formed and sworn into office on January 9, 1967, holding its first official meeting on February 23, 1967. Dr. Benito F. Reyes was elected as PLM's pioneer president.
*   **Location:** On February 5, 1970, Executive Secretary Ernesto M. Maceda conveyed two parcels of land owned by the Republic of the Philippines to the City of Manila, which is the area where PLM stands today.
*   **Formal Opening:** The University College formally opened on **Monday, July 17, 1967**, with an initial enrollment of 556 outstanding scholars selected from the upper 10% of Manila's public high schools. The Graduate College was established a year later, followed by the Institute for Extramural Studies.
