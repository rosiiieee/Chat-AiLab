Upon admission, the student binds himself/herself to complying with existing PLM rules, guidelines, and policies. Student discipline is essential for quality education.

**Objectives of Student Discipline**
1.  To establish and strengthen harmonious relationships among students, faculty, and administration.
2.  To inculcate the value of standards of behavior, rules of conduct, and discipline.
3.  To assist students in recognizing and performing their duties and responsibilities.

**Section 1: General Code of Conduct**
Violations are met with corresponding disciplinary action.
*   **1. Uniform (Dress Code):** Students must wear the prescribed school uniform (bearing the PLM patch) on weekdays. On Saturdays and free days, decent and presentable civilian attire conforming to the University dress code is allowed. PE, CWTS, or ROTC uniforms are not substitutes, unless that is the only class/subject for the day.
*   **PLM Identification Cards (IDs):** Students shall wear official IDs at all times within University premises or during University-sanctioned activities. Students must not use or lend their ID or Registration Form to another person.
*   **2. Respect:** Every student is expected to give due respect to all University officials and employees.
*   **3. Cleanliness:** Cleanliness and orderliness of classrooms and activity areas must be maintained.
*   **4. Conservation:** Students must help conserve resources through proper and careful use of facilities.
*   **5. Gadgets:** Use of personal mobile phones and electronic devices shall adhere to classroom, laboratory, or activity area policies.
*   **6. Grooming:** Male students are required to have a clean and decent haircut; ponytail, clipped hair, mohawk, total baldness, zigzag, and punk hairstyles are to be avoided. Female students shall adhere to a well-groomed hairstyle.
*   **7. Outsiders:** Students are not allowed to bring outsiders inside the University without due permission from the approving authority.

**Disciplinary Interventions**
There are six (6) categories of disciplinary interventions:
1.  **Warning:** A reprimand cautioning the student from repeating a similar act. Given in verbal and written form.
2.  **Community/Campus Service:** Requires unpaid work in designated University areas for a specific timeframe determined by the OSDS.
3.  **Suspension:** Student is barred from attending classes and University-sanctioned activities for a specific period.
    *   **Preventive Suspension:** May be imposed during investigation if evidence of guilt is strong, and the student's continued presence poses a threat or distraction to University operations.
4.  **Non-readmission:** Denial of admission or enrollment for the school term immediately following the resolution. Transfer credentials are issued upon promulgation.
5.  **Exclusion:** The student's name is dropped from the roll immediately upon resolution. Transfer credentials are issued upon promulgation.
6.  **Expulsion:** Administrative penalty resulting in removal from the University and barring enrollment in all public and private schools in the country. Imposed upon approval/ratification of the VPAA.
